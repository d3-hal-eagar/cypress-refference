Cypress automated tests with Cucumber specs.


##### Required

* git:
  * (Manually) Go to https://git-scm.com and download the latest version of git.
  * (homebrew) `brew install git`
* Nodejs (version 8 or 10):
  * (Manually) Go to www.nodejs.org and download the latest stable version. (At the moment it is LTS v10)
  * (homebrew) `brew install node`
* docker:

install
    
    npm install

run tests interactive (for debug or authoring)

    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress open
    aka> npm run test
    
    node_modules/.bin/cypress open --config 'integrationFolder=cypress/integration/inprogress'
    aka> npm run cypress:inprogress
    
 run tests headless (for ci, note generates video files of runs)
    
    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run 
    
 run tests headless and report to cypress dashboard
    
    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --record --key f3230691-58fd-4a68-9a0d-9ceb252be8e6
- not planning to use cypress dashboard for CI runs CI reporting should be enough/good
- usfull however if a dev wants persistent or sharable reports       


Run tests specifying a glob of where to look for test files

    - for CI pipeline testing
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/exampletests/**/*' 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/exampletests/passing/**/*' 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/exampletests/failing/**/*' 
    - don't run these on CI they are not complete
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/pending/**/*' 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/inprogress/**/*' 
    - real world final tests for CI 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/ci/**/*' 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/ci/component/**/*' 
    cypress run --spec 'cypress/integration/ci/end2end/**/*' 
    
> though cypress docs indicate you can input a specific spec file 
or list of spec files this does not work with the cucumber .features files
only sub-folder globing works

Reports
-
- mocha junit report files found in /src/cypress/reports
    - junit xml format
    - xml file per cucumber Feature
    - multiple tests (scenario) per file
    - file name pre-pended with hash (mocha's way of handling parallel tests)
- Videos of test runs found in /src/cypress/videos
    - mp4 format
    - only generated with headless run
    - one per feature
    - follow the filename and folder structure of the feature files indies 'integration'
- Screenshots of tests found in /src/cypress/screenshots
    - auto generated on fail
        - file name from the feature and scenario title (text in the file not filename)
    - Screenshots generated by step code defaults to above name but can be set in step code
    
> these paths are configurable as needed https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/configuration.html#Folders-Files

> if *trashAssetsBeforeRuns* in src/cypress.json is set *true* the video and screenshot folder and all .xml files in reports folder are deleted before test run
    
when running with --record and sending report data to the cypress.io dashboard the last line of the run will include the url
of the report, benefits of the dashboard report are integration of video and screencaptures as well as a single report when running multiple specs
unfortunately there will still be multiple reports if they are run in parallel on different test environments.

    Recorded Run: https://dashboard.cypress.io/#/projects/cwb5ky/runs/4    
    
Configuration
-
set in src/cypress.json

can be overridden in command line 

    cypress run --config integrationFolder=mobile,viewportWidth=320,viewportHeight=600
    
can be overridden by enviroment variables

    export CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=800
    export CYPRESS_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=600
    export CYPRESS_viewportHeight=600
    export CYPRESS_baseUrl=https://ci.host
    export CYPRESS_TESTMODE=mobile
